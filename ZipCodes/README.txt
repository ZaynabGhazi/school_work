Discussion:

When I was using Linear search, the program took about 16 seconds to run (real):

real	0m16.917s
user	0m13.735s
sys	0m0.463s

However, after using Binary search, the program takes less than 1 second to run (real):

real	0m0.765s
user	0m2.063s
sys	0m0.291s

Therefore, binary search is way more efficient than linear search.
